####Creating a Hello World
Let's create a hello world. First head over to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download node.js. When it is installed and ready, create a new Javascript file with the following.

```
console.log("Hello World");

```

Now you can save the file, call it something like "hello.js" and run it with the following command.

```
node hello.js

```

So now you should see "Hello World" appear in your terminal.
